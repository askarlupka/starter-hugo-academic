ABSTRACT = {The initial exposure to influenza virus usually occurs during childhood. This imprinting has long-lasting effects on the immune responses to subsequent infections and vaccinations. Animal models that are used to investigate influenza pathogenesis and vaccination do recapitulate the pre-immune history in the human population. The establishment of influenza pre-immune ferret models is necessary for understanding infection and transmission and for designing efficacious vaccines.},
