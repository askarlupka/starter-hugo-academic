I am a data scientist and immunologist passionate about all things data. From the benefits of data sharing and reuse, to the privacy and safety concerns of untrustworthy AI development and vague informed consent statements. The integration of Tribal data sovereignty into our current data systems seems like a puzzle worth solving! In addition to AI/ML methods, ethics, and regulation, I strongly believe in inclusive clinical research design utilizing community engagement building trust to tackle disparities in research over computational methods. 

As a Health Scientist Administrator - Program Officer  at NIH. I communicate between principal investigators, program officers and contractors to facilitate data sharing outlined in data sharing and management plans. Further, I'm instrumental in planning the initial studies for the new [Cancer Screening Research Network](https://prevention.cancer.gov/major-programs/cancer-screening-research-network-csrn) being initialized in 2024. 

I am also a [Presidential Management Fellow](https://www.pmf.gov) alumni, where I refined my leadership style and gained hands-on experience in project management. During my PhD, I designed and developed an influenza neuramindase-based vaccine platform. I concurrently completed a MS in Biostatistics and Epidemiology at the University of Georgia’s School of Public Health. There I was mentored under [Dr. Andreas Handel](https://www.andreashandel.com/) and completed my degree with a concentration in Data Analysis and Modeling defining a method for quantifying the breadth of influenza vaccine antibody responses.
<p> I maintain interest in current research techniques, regulations, and policy to see what can be brought to the cancer prevention field. By combining my expertise in experimental, computational, and leadership techniques, I facilitate communication between diverse parties to drive innovation.
