During my PhD I designed and developed an influenza neuramindase-based vaccine platform. Further, I concurrently completed a MS in Biostatistics and Epidemiology at the University of Georgiaâ€™s School of Public Health. There I was mentored under Dr. Andreas Handel and completed my concentration in Data Analysis and Modeling defining a method for quantifying the breadth of an influenza vaccine antibody response. My work at the NCI constitutes working with the principal investigators, program officers and contractors to facilitate data sharing outlined in data sharing and management plans. I also maintain interest in current research techniques and enjoy participating in outside research to see what can be brought to the cancer prevention field. By combining my expertise in experimental and computational techniques I aim to provide an interface to facilitate communication between interested parties that have differing backgrounds.
